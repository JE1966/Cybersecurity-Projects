# Malware Forensic Investigation and Risk Assessment

This project involves a comprehensive investigation of malicious network activity captured in a packet capture file. The pcap file in question has been sourced from https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2024/07/30/index.html, from the traffic analysis exercise titled, "You Dirty Rat!" (note that the pcap file has not been included in this repo). The objective is to reconstruct the attack lifecycle and provide actionable risk mitigation strategies based on the findings.

## Provided Environment Data:

**LAN segment range:**  172.16.1[.]0/24 (172.16.1[.]0 through 172.16.1[.]255)
**Domain:**  wiresharkworkshop[.]online
**Domain controller:**  172.16.1[.]4 - WIRESHARK-WS-DC
**LAN segment gateway:**  172.16.1[.]1
**LAN segment broadcast address:**  172.16.1[.]255


## Tools Utilized
To ensure environment safety, the analysis was conducted within a secure Remnux virtual machine. 
- **Wireshark:** The captured network traffic was analyzed using Wireshark for deep packet inspection (DPI) to help identify the initial attack and malicious activity.
- **Zui:** Zui was used for further log visualization and to identify suspicious traffic. 
- **Python:** Python was utilized to develop a custom script for automated IoC extraction.
